# 🔍 Multimodal Intrusion Detection & Incident Response System

## 🛡️ Project Summary: Edge-Efficient Multimodal Security

This repository contains an **academic prototype** for an **Edge-Efficient Multimodal Intrusion Detection & Incident Response (EMIDIR)** system.

The core goal is to leverage advanced AI techniques to fuse highly diverse, asynchronous sensor signals—**RGB video, thermal video, audio, and RF spectrum**—to dramatically reduce false alarms and determine the optimal security patrol dispatch under strict edge computing constraints (low latency, minimal power, and memory). This project focuses on learning, experimentation, and building a complete pipeline structure.

## 🔮 Future Scope (Planned Enhancements)

The following areas are targeted for development beyond the initial academic scope:

*   **Adaptive Compression:** Implement dynamic model pruning/quantization based on real-time hardware thermals and CPU load (G.67) to ensure graceful degradation.
    
*   **Sensor Reliability:** Incorporate a dynamic, learned weighting scheme for sensor reliability based on real-time environmental data (e.g., heavy rain or high ambient noise) to improve fusion accuracy.
    
*   **Full MLOps Pipeline:** Integrate a robust **Drift Monitor** (KS test/PSI) with auto-recalibration hooks (G.69) to maintain model accuracy as attack patterns or environment change over time.
